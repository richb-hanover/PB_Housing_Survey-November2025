What would the tax rate have to be to maintain school spending with 20% more kids?  Will the faction that wants no change like what they see in 10 years if we do nothing now?

I agree with Rusty regarding the significant gaming of the tax system by some landowners in Lyme to offset their land taxes at the expense of the rest of us without large tracts of land.  The forestry argument is sock-puppetry to divert from addressing this underlying problem.  \n\n1a) Having essentially all undeveloped land in current use/conservation easement means there will never be land available to put a cell tower in town.  Bravo, Lyme, on the self-inflicted wound keeping us stuck in the 1990s telecommunications-wise.\n\n2) Renegotiate Hanover HS tuition.\nA few years ago, Jeff Valence said there would be negotiations with the Dresden School district to address the very high tuition payments the town makes to send kids to HHS.  70% of Lyme HS kids now go to HHS, and that school has the HIGHEST public tuition in the state.  In addition, financial incentives need to be implemented to compel parents to send their kids to other schools.\n\n3) Increase *realistic* commercial development. \nConsider making a list of what types of companies would be fine with no sewer or town water.  What companies would be fine with 3000 cars per day?  Look at nearby towns to the N/W/E of us that have similar limitations.  Gyms, nurseries (*cough* Menges' NIMBY *cough*), pop-up coffee shops, offices, used book stores.  I think the bar has been set too high in that people expect only top-tier, high quality commercial enterprises to come in, but it has to start organically, which will mean a little lower quality at first.  Let's not be too precious about ourselves here.\n\n4) Increase revenue by adding aging-in-place communities. \nContinually changing the goalposts for getting the Pinnacle Project certified is absurd and shameful.  The pearl-clutching whaddaboutism and scaremongering of the Planning Board is farcical and embarrassing.  Seriously, I'd be fine if the Bailey's *voluntarily* cashed out their farm and we got more houses and businesses there.  Good for them.  That's the market at work.  Let's not hamstring our town because we want to see cute goats and turkeys on our commute home in the evening.\n\n5) Increased commercially zoned locations in town.\nWest Thetford Road, Rte 10 North near Mill Gardens, near skiway, Rte 10 South of town.",

Similar reasons are why Ithaca NY prospers in the middle of upstate New York (i.e. Cornell), while other towns on the Finger Lakes are dying.  So while we all say it's our town's esprit de corps that sets us apart, people think the same no matter where there are.  **Honestly** it's location and money.  And the money is here because of location.   Consider how town projects, big and small, are funded by the local super-wealthy (Lyme Fiber, new sheet for town ice rink, Lyme Foundation grants, etc.)  Lyme residents do a very good job on making this happen, and it needs to continue, and even be enhanced, as the town moves forward.

Not unsightly garden apartment complexes or co-housing, but smallish, affordable single-family homes in developments not unlike, for example, what we have above Whipple Hill (scaled down). We should find ways to encourage small businesses to move to Lyme, as Northern Woodlands has done. New Hampshire Business Review had an interesting article recently -- https://www.nhbr.com/a-hub-for-tech-entrepreneurship/ -- that bragged about how popular the Upper Valley is for tech start-ups and medical device entrepreneurs, with most of them landing in and near Lebanon and finding it relatively easier to attract and retain qualified employees because of all the fringe benefits of moving to the Upper Valley. I think we can learn from that. For instance, think about the house for sale right now on the Common, between the library and the Consolidated Communications structure: wouldn't it make a perfect office space for a start-up or two, with all the advantages of small-town living, amazing recreational opportunities, a great elementary school and proximity to a major college with an engineering school and a first-rate medical center. Wow. We should encourage the right \"developer\" to buy that and convert it to office space, not unlike the building on the eastern end of the Common where Northern Woodlands has settled in. The Wagner building on Route 10 at the intersection of North Thetford Road is another great example of how a tax-paying business can easily fit into the corridor along Route 10, even among homes. Estes & Gallup is another great example. The Common and Route 10 should be our focus. The small house (Bill Gray) across from town hall has been for sale for a while. That, too, would be the perfect spot for the right kind of economic development -- office space for some start-ups, etc. It's quite close to the office park north of town. Seems like a perfect fit.

But that alone will not allow us to successfully attract and retain people of all economic levels. Right now the attitude seems to be to \"just say no.\" And aside from the major battle that the anti-development crowd sometimes loses (Bret Ryan), that is not going to get us any form of progress. We need to encourage smart development. At this point, it seems as if that will be a very difficult objective to pull off. One last thought that was mentioned briefly in the public comment section of the presentation video: we should focus more time and effort at looking at what other towns have done to be successful in managing their growth, keeping their expenses in line and slowing the tax increases. Surely in the region, the state or in other rural areas in the Northeast, some towns have done this much better than others and we ought to be able to learn from their successes. That would definitely be worth an investment of time. But learning those answers without a change in attitude toward modest development won't get us anywhere. "

At the moment, Lyme is primarily a place where people live, and where some operate their own small businesses. And that's really great!! The reality of living in Lyme would change a lot, and in my opinion for the worse, with more and bigger commercial venues. Being a primarily residential place is something that defines Lyme and makes us unique from some other towns to the south, and I think that is a benefit that draws people to live here. \n\nI also see that the town wants to expand their tax base, but to me any housing development that is pushed in the town should explicitly include units that make Lyme an accessible place to live for all people, not only for wealthy people who can pay a lot of taxes. Further gentrifying our town will probably only lead to more demands for more municipal services, and I see this as a runaway cycle that would lead to then another need to charge more taxes to provide these services. Thinking about the future of the town, let's think about the sense of community and how we can keep a vibrant, friendly, supportive, and resilient community, instead of just how we can make a community that pays more taxes.

   "Takeaway": "The main message seemed to be that there's not much we can do, development-wise, to ease Lyme's tax burden.  That outcome, however, seems to be driven to some extent by the underlying modeling inputs, which assume a given impact (e.g., on number and \"type\" of kids, and hence school budgets, etc.) for each housing scenario.  Actual experience would suggest that real-world results can be much more volatile.  For example, just one new student who requires special services from the school (e.g., additional student aids, or even out-of-district placement) can blow up a budget and render the modeler's assumptions totally moot.  As such, ANY scenario that includes ANY sort of school-age kids is highly uncertain.  As Jeff Valence joked in the video, \"Do you feel lucky?\"  In the end, I'm not sure that we can read too much into the modeling study -- except perhaps to assume that the potential downside (i.e., higher taxes from additional housing) is far greater than the potential upside.  In other words, additional development is unlikely to help taxes all that much (consistent with the modeler's results), but it could very well end up hurting taxes much more than shown in the modeling results.\n\nTwo other, more-general critiques of the modeling study:  (1) the focus on comparing Lyme to the rest of Grafton County rather than to other Upper Valley communities seemed short-sighted (I agree with Karl Furstemberg's comment to this effect); and (2) the scope of the modeling scenarios all seemed to involve either housing or retail development, and ignored other forms of potential development that could generate revenue for the town (e.g., a solar farm or something like that -- something that can generate revenue but require little or no town services).  It would have been nice to see a little more \"out of the box\" thinking along these lines, rather than focusing on only new housing or a WalMart (or a Market Basket).\n\nAt the end of the day, given that we're stuck relying on property taxes to raise revenue, and given the high percentage of property in town that is either not taxed or taxed at a very low rate, we may need to look outside of Lyme -- e.g., to Concord -- for solutions.  I agree with Jennifer Boylston's comments that we should lobby for consideration of more-equitable statewide distribution of the \"current use\" burden, or even a statewide income tax.\n\nOne other half-baked idea:  Can we convert some town roads to toll roads, at least for out-of-town users?  For example, the dirt section of Dorchester Road gets a lot of out-of-town users (e.g., traveling to Smarts Mountain or Green Woodlands) who presumably inflict quite a bit of damage to the road surface when it's soft (like in mud season).  Same with River Road, which is used by commuters to Hanover.  Lyme ends up footing the bill to keep these roads in decent shape, even though Lyme residents are probably responsible for only a fraction of the damage.  Given today's technology (e.g., EZPass, cameras, etc.), it seems like there should be a way to easily and cost-effectively collect tolls -- but is it legal?  More broadly, what about paving some of these dirt roads?\n",

   "Change": "It would obviously be nice to reduce the cost of living here!  Seeing a little more vibrancy and variety in the commercial districts (e.g., downtown, at the old Getty station, at Lyme Business Park just north of town) would make it a nicer place to live (as having to drive north or south for some basic services gets a little old).",

   "How-address": "The increases seem too high when compared to the general rate of inflation (negligible) over this same period.  I do understand, however, that there have been some larger-than-normal road problems that have contributed to costs.  More-proactive road maintenance (e.g., I can't remember the last time our dirt road was ditched -- making it more-susceptible to washouts), or even paving some roads that are now dirt, could potentially avert some costly fixes down the road.  \n\nIf development (or at least housing/retail development, as studied) is unlikely to raise much tax revenue, then we need to sharpen our focus on costs, and cut where we can.\n\nFinally, Lyme is also one of the wealthiest towns in the state -- how about lobbying for an income tax, which would equalize the tax burden a bit more?  Those who are wealthy will hardly notice; those who are struggling with the property tax burden because they don't have much income will presumably feel some relief.",
