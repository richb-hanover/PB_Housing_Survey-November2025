More importantly, Lyme needs a balance of housing types to sustain a healthy, multigenerational community. If new housing is restricted based on potential school growth, it risks excluding younger families entirely, which could lead to a long-term decline in school enrollment and community vibrancy.  Instead of treating school capacity as a constraint, Lyme can plan for moderate, well-placed housing growth that keeps enrollment stable, supports local teachers and staff, and helps maintain the town’s social and economic vitality.","Creating housing with a mix of price ranges, Helping people stay in the community as they age, “In-fill” development – adding additional units on a parcel (ADU’s or separate buildings)",More than 20 years,No,"I grew up in Lyme, and I understand that every community needs to evolve and adapt over time.

I would love to believe that I would be able to stay here after I retire which will happen in 5-10 years. It is indeed disappointing and somewhat disenfranchising as I've heard and participated in many conversations about taxes and services in Lyme, yet all seem to fall on deaf ears in the end. ",46 to 65 years,Maybe in the future,"Once my kids are gone, I don't see a point to continuing to live in and maintain a 4 bedroom 3000 sq ft house. In most other American communities, people can downsize as they age without moving away from the community that they lived in and loved for decades. It would be nice if Lyme could figure that out, particularly considering the wealth of models out there to look at. The Planning Board, Zoning Board, Select Board seem quite focused on not building or on disallowing building out of fear that people with students might move to town. Funny thing is, I see that happening often, particularly people with multiple kids building large single family homes. If we build smaller units, people would possibly have something to downsize to and from my perspective, small units would not be desirable for families with kids anyway. ",Own your own home,"I hesitated to complete this survey as I have lived here for almost 20 years and have heard this conversation about housing for most of those 20 years. Ad nauseum. Nothing happens. There seems to be no personal at the proverbial ""wheel"". I'm not a huge fan of NH state government but feel buoyed by the possibility that change will eventually happen due to their impatience with towns like Lyme that just refuse to build anything. I am a person who would like to stay in Lyme, work here in the community and with people in the community. It is disheartening to today believe that this may not be possible. Keep in mind that many people, if/when they believe they either cannot afford to stay here, maintain a large home, or become frustrated by the high tax rate that is not accompanied by needed service(s), will sell. And, who will buy the 4br single family homes? People with kids. So, the problem that you are focused on keeping from happening looms even if you don't build. Another issue I'd point to - assessed value of homes. Many homes seem to be a bit off in terms of assessed/market value. Improving the assessments so that they better reflect/match market value could help quite a few people (1) control budgets (2) impart fairness to the tax code. Building? Try for  small units. 1 br. 2 br. Small but functional kitchens. A tv room and a bath. Keep it simple. But, worth pointing out that building is not the only means of solving/making taxes more reasonable for many people. "

With that read, 

A) In aggregate, these four committee members alone own 1% of the town’s land and decreased their annual property taxes by $56,545.  

B) The Lyme budget increased $155,969 between 2024 (actual) and 2025 (proposed).  

C) 36% of the 2024 to 2025 budget increase was contained in the tax strategies of just four of these Committee members.

Next part.  Let’s compare those to the property of another committee member.

Vicki Smith, 1.1 acres, on Market Street.
Assessed (taxable) Value	$205,300 ($186,636/acre)
Appraised Value	$205,300 ($186,636/acre)
0% tax reduction vs. appraised
—> $28.19/$1000 x ($0)(1.1 acres)= $0 saved from Lyme’s tax bill each year by Ms. Smith ($5787 actual tax on land.)  

With that read, 

A) Small parcel of in the Lyme Common district have no opportunity for conservation easement and current use tax reduction schemes that owners of larger parcels of land in town make use of.  

B) As we see with Ms. Smith’s property, small parcels of land in parts of Lyme can much higher the assessed land tax rate than larger lots.  Specifically here, Ms. Smith pays 50x the assessed rate per acre than the average assessed rate of the four committee members above.

C) Chairman Menge pays less in tax on his 180 acres than Ms. Smith paid on her 1 acre.

This. is. bonkers.

So I’m very aware of how the Republican-led NH legislature is downshifting costs to property taxes in towns and cities, and how this is ballooning costs.

Regardless of that issue, what we are dealing with above is local tax gamesmanship of conservation easement and current use policies by the few to the determent of the many.  And some of those making use of this are reading this right now.

So when the community is asked to figure out how to afford to live in this town, we’re going to have to deal with how a small number of residents (including members of this committee) are people figured out to drastically reduce their tax liability using conservation easement and current use.    And you’ve asked the rest who can’t exploit that legal loophole to come up with answers.  We’re pointing at your loopholes.   

What I request is this:

Give us the total dollar amount in assessed vs. appraised LAND value in Lyme.  What’s the difference between those two numbers?  And what would be the tax on that difference? 
From there, let’s imagine a path where that assessed value went up 10% closer to the appraised value… or 25%… or 50%.  What would happen to our OVERALL town and school budget?  Give us the numbers -  We’re all smart people here - most of us have advanced degrees.  That way we get an idea of how much more the smaller parcels in town are paying in taxes to subsidize the tax schemes of the larger landholders.  

I think that’s important to know, as because as Mr. Kahn said recently,  “I don’t know if it’s fair to ask the citizens of the town of Lyme to use their taxes to subsidize an individual family like that.”  ",7,6,5,4,2,3,1-LEAST Appropriate,8-MOST Appropriate,,,,"Single family home, Duplex (two family), 3- 6 dwelling units in a building","Lyme Common District, Lyme Center District, Rural District, Nearby Thetford Bridge",Yes,No,"I had a member of the zoning board tell me that the PURPOSELY slowed down building in Lyme to keep new kids out of the Lyme School.

You did your job, got your housing value appreciation, and screwed over the next generation of new Lymies.  Enjoy your retirement, but don’t complain you can’t afford to live here.

However, I think Lyme desperately needs to focus on Affordable housing, much more so than attainable housing. 

My ideas about how to do it (in no particular order, just thoughts): 
- one key thing is to have more affordable rental units while avoiding the slum lord problem. Maybe find local folks who can rent out a barn apartment or ADU at a reasonable rate. 
- Allow for tiny home communities, mobile homes, and small owner/builder projects. This is all very much in the spirit of what I think of as Upper Valley culture, but permitting can make this hard. Based on conversations I've had with friends in the area, adults spanning from gen z to millenials (my age) to recently retired folks all like the idea of living in easy-to-maintain, close knit communities- both for raising children and for aging in place. If the permitting could allow for the construction of little developments like this, I think that would be sweet. While some folks like being isolated in the woods, lots of us would enjoy having more of a whole community in the woods!

- Second home tax? Don't know if this is in the town's power or not. But if someone is rich enough to own a second home, maybe they could be taxed to put money towards subsidized affordable housing. 

- If that's not possible or too hard, you could always ask the rich folks of Lyme to contribute to a housing cost assistance program, and run it through something like the Utility Club.

While the owning land seems wrong to me on principal, I would like that security, and wherever I can find a spot that I can afford and is in a good community (one that actively fosters a sense of community, helps each other out) and allows me to live life like I want to, is where I will go. In the 4ish years I have been here, I have loved Lyme for those reasons, so who knows! it is VERY expensive.",18 to 45 years,Yes,Not quite sure what you mean by this question. Do I hope to buy/rent a smaller house as opposed to a bigger one? It depends. ,Rent,"Big picture, I think we can, need to, and should try to find ways to create more affordable housing (and ACTUALLY affordable- even the ""affordable rent"" listed is VERY expensive. I recently disqualified myself from Medicaid by exceeding the income limit, which is several hundred dollars less per month than the ""affordable"" rent. That just makes no sense, and is one of the ways NH feels very hostile). 

I think infilling is a no brainer, as is encouraging multiunit homes. Obviously the larger the development, the more carefully it should be considered, but making duplexes seems like an absolute no-brainer. 

I do also really love the idea of tiny home communities or little ecovillages. Imagine small, dense pockets of housing (and ideally some shared amenities) within our lovely rural area. That seems like the ideal to me. It makes all sorts of sharing easier too- rides, resources, services, etc. (and sharing is a way to make life more affordable and to stay connected to your neighbors!) 

I am particularly interested in this as a young person (and woman who is hoping to have children), because of all the research showing that the isolated nuclear family is generally really bad for parents' mental health, and that raising children in a ""village"" is much better for everyone involved. On the other end of the spectrum, aging around young people and living in intergenerational housing is also good for all of us, and is what I want personally. 

I know water and septic can be an issue and I doubt this will catch on, but we could start to consider ""humanure"" (reading: The Humanure Handbook). Composting toilet systems can be so great in so many ways. 

Very random, and maybe not super related, but we should also have a tool library. The elimination of excessive individual tool storage could make space for more housing. Think of how many barns are out there letting the same kinds of tools get dusty. We could consolidate and share! A favorite phrase of mine is ""convenience comes at the cost of community"""
